### Will Swift rule the world?
Apple new raising star “Swift” is a langage that has seduced a large number of developers this year. With the announcement of Swift going open source and running on Linux, can we run Swift everywhere? 

Are you ready?

Switching to Swift is not just adopting a nice-looking syntax, it’s a paradigm switch: type-safe language, immutability at his heart, Swift embraces the functional programming paradigms. Developers have a new powerful swiss knife in their tool-box. Do you want to see in practice hof, functors and monads running on an iPhone? 

Working on open source libraries for AeroGear / FeedHenry, I’ve switched to Swift from day one, I’d like to share with you my experience and show you some of the super powers I’ve discovered when coding the Swift way. Tips will be illustrated with code snippets taken from open source libraries.
